Tk-Gpack version 0.05
=====================

DESCRIPTION
##########################

Gpack uses a series of single letter abbreviations to expand packing or gridding 
options. The functions these strings are as follows: gpack xpack spack tpack, ggrid xgrid 
sgrid and tgrid.  by using this module all of these functions will be exported into 
the Tk namespace.

SYNOPSIS
##########################

gpack qw($frame1 stawx1fx $frame2 stawx1fb $frame3 stawx1fb) ; # group pack

# same as: 
# $frame1->pack(side => top, -anchor => w, -expand => 1, -fill => x) ;   
# $frame2->pack(-side => top, -anchor => w, -expand => 1, -fill => both) ;   
# $frame3->pack(-side => top, -anchor => w, -expand => 1, -fill => both) ;    

$button1->xpack('slan', -in => $frame1)  ; # expand pack

# same as: 
# $button1->pack(-side => left, -anchor => n, -in => $frame1) ; 

tpack qw($frame1 $button1 slan $button2 slan) ; # target pack 

# same as: 
# $button1->pack(-side => left, -anchor => north, -in => $frame1) ; 
# $button2->pack(-side => left, -anchor => north, -in => $frame1) ; 
 
$derivedbutton1->configure(-geometry => 'slan') ; 
$derivedbutton1->spack(-in => $frame3)          ; # self pack 

# Note: This only works with Derived objects that define a -geometry ConfigSpec. 
# Effectively this allows any derived widgets you create to embed their own 
# gpack or ggrid formated string.  

ggrid qw($button1 r0c0 $button2 r10c10) ; # group grid 

# Grids buttons in opposite corners. 

tgrid qw($frame1 $button1 r0c0 $button2 r10c10) ; # target grid 

# stick $button1 and button2 in $frame1 and in opposite corners

$button1->xgrid('r5c15', -in => $someframe) ; # expand grid

# grid it, and stick it in $someframe

$derivedbutton1->configure(-geometry => 'r0c2') ; 
$derivedbutton1->sgrid() ; # self grid 

#Note: as above sgrid is dependent on the the widget being Derived.
